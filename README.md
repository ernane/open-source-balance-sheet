# Balance Sheet
A balance sheet is a financial statement that shows what the business is worth at a given point in time.

The balance sheet presents a company's financial position at the end of a specified date. Some describe the balance sheet as a "snapshot" of the company's financial position at a point (a moment or an instant) in time. For example, the amounts reported on a balance sheet dated December 31, 2016 reflect that instant when all the transactions through December 31 have been recorded.

# The Components of a Balance Sheet
  * **Assets** (what the business owns)
  * **Liabilities** (what the business owes)
  * **Owner's Equity** (what the business is worth)

# Assets
Assets are things that the company owns. They are the resources of the company that have been acquired through transactions, and have future economic value that can be measured and expressed in dollars.

# Liabilities
A liability is an amount that a company owes. Typically, a liability involves money borrowed in order to support business activities, so can also include accounts payable and general debt.

# Owner's Equity
Assets less liabilities equals the equity balance. Any remaining value in assets can be attributed to ownerâ€™s equity.
